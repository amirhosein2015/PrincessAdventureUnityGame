## 🌟 Overview
**Princess Adventure** is a 3D fantasy adventure game where you play as a brave princess on a journey to restore peace to her kingdom.  
Developed in **Unity** using **C#**, this project demonstrates solid gameplay architecture, smooth mechanics, and clean code organization.  
It’s both **a fun demo** and **a learning project** for aspiring game developers.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🕹️ Smooth third-person movement and camera control  
- 🏰 Immersive 3D world: forests, caves, castles, and magical areas  
- 💎 Collectibles, checkpoints, and quest system  
- ⚙️ Modular and reusable **C# scripts** for input, gameplay, and UI  
- 🚀 Scalable structure for adding enemies, puzzles, and new levels  

---

## 🧩 Technical Details
- **Engine:** Unity 3D  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Folders:**
  - `Assets/` → Models, Textures, Prefabs, and Scenes  
  - `Scripts/` → Gameplay logic, managers, UI handlers  
  - `ProjectSettings/` → Physics, input, layers, etc.  
- **Design Philosophy:**
  - Clean and readable C# code  
  - Reusable components (e.g., `CharacterController`, `Interactable`)  
  - Scene flow: `Main Menu → Level Select → Gameplay → End Scene`

---

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out
- 🧠 Great for practicing **Unity** and **C#** game development  
- 🏗️ Real-world project structure similar to professional studios  
- 🔁 Extendable foundation for combat, AI, multiplayer, etc.  
- 🧩 Simple but powerful gameplay systems for learning purposes
